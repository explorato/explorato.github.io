### Things to Try

* Rotate the graphic by holding down your mouse and dragging to see that the waves looks the same from all directions

* Click "random" to see the wave traveling through a random distribution of particles

* Change the variable named "amplitude" in the `displacement()` function to change the size of the oscillations

* Change the code in the `displacement()` function to distort the spherical nature of the wave
 
### About the Code

Since it is easier to modify a geometry in Three.js rather than recreate it, the `updateScene()` function moves the vertices of the geometry. Clicking "lattice" moves them to the orderly positions of the lattice array, while clicking "random" moves them to arbitrary positions. The variable named "balls" is one less than the number of particles along each edge of the geometry.

Platonic solids or regular polyhedra are convex shapes whose faces are all identical regular polygons. There are five Platonic solids:

* Tetrahedron with four triangular faces

* Cube with six square faces

* Octahedron with eight triangular faces

* Dodecahedron with twelve pentagonal faces

* Icosahedron with twenty triangular faces

### Things to Try

* Change the rates of rotation of the polyhedra

* Try resizing and moving the polyhedra to either fit inside one another or enclose one another

### About the Code

This exhibit is rather simple to implement because all of these shapes are already defined in Three.js!

### A Little Math

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid#Cartesian_coordinates">Cartesian coordinates</a> of the vertices for the tetrahedron, cube and octahedron can be determined using integers, but those for the dodecahedron and icosahedron require the golden ratio

\\[ \phi = \frac{ 1 + \sqrt{5} }{ 2 } \\]

This golden ratio is an interesting number well worth exploring further!

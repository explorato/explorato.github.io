People have been charting heavenly bodies and their attributes since the beginning of humankind. These efforts have been fraught with difficulty, covered small numbers of bodies and require much learning. This exhibit shows that creating a real-time 3D [orrery]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery ) - using modern technology - is pretty simple with a small amount of easy-to-read code.

### Things to Try

* Click on a star to see all of the data available for it

* Zoom into the center of the visualization to find our sun

* What is the most common type of stars near us?
 
### About the Code

The colors of stars are set according their luminosity because the physical color of a star is determined by its temperature. The values for colors are taken from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification'>Harvard spectral classification</a>.

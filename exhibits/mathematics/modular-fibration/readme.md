The modular fibration is a mapping that associates a point on a two-dimensional spherical surface with a [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot) on a three-dimensional spherical surface. Since the three-dimensional surface exists in a four-dimensional space, it cannot be visualized directly. Instead the trefoils in four dimensions are brought down to our three-dimensional space using stereographic projection. This is the same mechanism as how a point light produces shadows of objects, so this method of visualizing four-dimensional objects is analogous to casting shadows down into our physical space.

If a single point corresponds to a trefoil with the modular fibration, a collection of points around a circle corresponds to a collection of interlocking trefoils. That is what you are seeing right now!

### Things to Try

* Change the value of the variable "ratio" to see its effect on the shape

* The variables "a", "b" and "c" were chosen as a circle around the x-axis to make the overall figure look like an extendend trefoil knot. Try choosing a different circle on the two-dimensional sphere for some radically different figures.
 
### About the Code

Concise parametrization code courtesy of [Niles Johnson](https://nilesjohnson.net), who also suggested this exhibit. Mathematical background and a more complicated parametrization are available here:

[Computer Simulation of the Modular Fibration](https://docs.google.com/a/aims.ac.za/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=YWltcy5hYy56YXxhcmNoaXZlfGd4OjU1ZDFlMjFiN2M2YjdlYTg)  

The code uses the [trigonometric solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Trigonometric_and_hyperbolic_solutions) of a cubic equation.

### A Little Math

See the source above for mathematical background on this topic. It's not simple, but the end result is pretty!

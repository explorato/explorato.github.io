A random walk is the name for the movement of particles in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>. At each step of the motion a random vector is added to the line being traced. Since the motion is completely random it can take any shape. The particle could stay right near its initial point the whole time or move away rapidly in any direction. These kinds of motion are possible but statistically unlikely, and the particle generally moves little by little out from the origin.

### About the Code

Once a geometry is added to a scene in Three.js it cannot be modified. That is why all vertices of the line are created at once. At each step all vertices but one are moved by the same random vector.

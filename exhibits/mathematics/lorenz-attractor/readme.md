### Things to Try

* Click the "Update View" button to see several instances of the attractor. The curve starts at a random point each time but the resulting figure looks the same. This is what is meant by an attractor.

* Increase the variable named "multiplier" to see the curve develop faster

* Change the values of the parameters named "beta" (&beta;), "rho" (&rho;) and "sigma" (&sigma;) to alter the nature of the attractor. You may also need to change the value of "scale" in order to see the developing curve, or zoom the view out.
 
### About the Code


### A Little Math

The Lorenz attractor is the solution of the coupled differential equations

\\[
\frac{ dx }{ dt } = \sigma ( y - x ) \\\\
\frac{ dy }{ dt } = \\\\
\frac{ dz }{ dt } =
\\]

The Hopf fibration is a mapping that associates a point on a two-dimensional spherical surface with a circle on a three-dimensional spherical surface. Since the three-dimensional surface exists in a four-dimensional space, it cannot be visualized directly. Instead the circles in four dimensions are projected down to our three-dimensional space using stereographic projection. This is the same mechanism as how a point light produces shadows of objects, so this method of visualizing four-dimensional objects is analogous to casting shadows down into our physical space.

If a single point corresponds to a circle with the Hopf fibration, a collection of points around a circle corresponds to a collection of interlocking circles. That is what you are seeing right now!

### Things to Try

* Change the value of the variable "ratio" to see its effect on the shape

* Replace the variable "r" multiplying the coordinates of the vertices of the geometry with the combination "1/(1-w)" to see a standard stereogrphic projection

* Replace the variable "r" multiplying the coordinates of the vertices of the geometry with other combinations
 
### About the Code

Parametrizations are taken from a combination of these two sources:

https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf-articles/Lyons_Elem-intro-Hopf-fibration.pdf  
https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf-production.html

The modified stereographic projection in the second source keeps the resulting graphic about the same size when input parameters change.

### A Little Math

See the second source for all the lovely details!

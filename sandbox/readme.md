A sandbox is a place to play with things and get your hands dirty.

This is a good place to put files before they are accepted into the principle exhibition areas.
Files placed here should go into a folder with the same name as would be used when exhibited.

## Template for Read Me and Read Me Reader

### GitHub.com folders display Markdown read me files
Every folder in displayed on GitHub.com comes with the possibility to properly format and display automatically a Markdown file with the title 'readme'md'.
This is a wonderful feature because it encourage providing background, nuance and further depth to all the files hosted on GitHub.

All significant folders in Exploratoria should exploit this feature and include a read me file.

This template begins to propose a standard template for Exploratoria read me files.

### GitHub.io pages display HTML
Every project in GitHub.com may also be used to serve static files - such as html, css and JavaScript files - via GitHub.io.
This is a wonderful feature because it enable the building of simple web sites to display projects hosted on GitHub.

All significant projects, exhibits and whatever should exploit this feature and include publicly accessible web pages

This template begins to propose a standard whereby the read me files described above may also be used to create web pages.

The benefit being write once, read twice.

## Coding Style & Colophon

### Style

The coding style of an app should follow the style of the most-used library of the app.

In the instance of a [Three.js]( http://threejs.org ) script, the style generally follows [Mr.doob Coding Style]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Mr.doob's-Code-Style%E2%84%A2 ).

* Code generally follows the Three.js examples coding style more than the source code style
	* Functions are functions not variables
	* Uses init() and animate() functions
	* Loads libraries from GitHub via a CDN
	* No external js or css files other then standard Three.js files
	* In other words, code for dummies

### Markdown

[Markdown]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown ) is used extensively with the [Showdown converter]( https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown ).

See [Markdown Basics]( https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/ )


### Fonts

The font used here is the the default 'monospace' font as determined by your browser. This is because it is the most common font used to write scripts.

### Versioning

* Trying out [semantic versioning]( http://semver.org/ )
* See [Version Manage]( http://exploratoria.github.io/sandbox/sandbox/version-manage/index.html ) project for more details

### Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

In order to prevent scripts breaking due to changes in new revsions, Exploratorion links libraries that are used to CDN

CDNs used:

* [CDNJS]( https://cdnjs.com/ )
	* <https://cdnjs.com/libraries/three.js>
* [RawGit]( https://rawgit.com/ )
	* Example: <https://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r70/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js>

As in:

```
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r71/build/three.min.js ></script>  
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r71/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js ></script>
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r71/examples/js/libs/stats.min.js ></script>  
```

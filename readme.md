Welcome to the Exploratoria home page!

Exploratoria is a GitHub Organization. Feel free to request an invitation to join. 

_See also the [raw source code]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exploratoria/exploratoria.github.io/master/readme.md ) of this file for notes embedded as comments_

## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
* To supply free, open source scripts that help visualize scientific and mathematical concepts

* To supply scripts that help engineers and designers to create visualizations without having to be dedicated software programmers

* To help youngsters and oldsters delve into new topics with a hands-on, active, 'I can play with this' approach

* To create apps that work not just on computers but also on mobile devices such as phones and tablets

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help create new types of visualizations

* To help people understand, tackle and push the envelope with increasingly complicated tasks

## Exhibits

The intention is to provide scripts dealing with the following categories:

* Astronomy & Solar System
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Color
* Electricity & Magnetism
* Energy
* Engineering & Structure
* Geology & Materials
* Heat & Temperature
* Human Anatomy
* Language & Speech
* Light
* Mathematics & Patterns
* Mechanics, Dynamics & Motion
* Navigation
* Smell - Taste - Touch
* Sound & Hearing
* Vision & Eye Logic
* Water
* Waves & Resonance
* Weather

<!-- this wording needs work -->
Noticeably absent are categories pertaining to computers, the Internet, digital media and the like. 
This website uses technology to explain, show and demonstrate the physical and theoretical aspects of our world. It attempts to achieve the best of what technology should do in the real world.

## Current Status

2015-09-05 ~ Still at a very early stage

This home page will eventually become an attractive place to land on the site.

The following information will be moved to other pages.


## Cookbook

Short coding samples - also called snippets - solutions to common tasks, 'presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results'.

[Cookbook - web page view]( http://exploratoria.github.io/cookbook/ )  
[Cookbook - source code view](  https://github.com/exploratoria/exploratoria.github.io/tree/master/cookbook/ )

## Templates

These are the files we use to build this web site. You can use them too.

## Coding Style & Colophon

### Style

The coding style of an app should follow the style of the most-used library of the app.

In the instance of a [Three.js]( http://threejs.org ) script, the style generally follows [Mr.doob Coding Style]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Mr.doob's-Code-Style%E2%84%A2 ).

* Code generally follows the Three.js examples coding style more than the source code style
	* Functions are functions not variables
	* Uses init() and animate() functions
	* Loads libraries from GitHub via a CDN
	* No external js or css files other then standard Three.js files
	* In other words, code for dummies

### Markdown

[Markdown]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown ) is used extensively with the [Showdown converter]( https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown ).

See [Markdown Basics]( https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/ )


### Fonts

The font used here is the the default 'monospace' font as determined by your browser. This is because it is the most common font used to write scripts.

### Versioning

* Trying out [semantic versioning]( http://semver.org/ )
* See [Version Manage]( http://exploratoria.github.io/sandbox/sandbox/version-manage/index.html ) project for more details

### Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

In order to prevent scripts breaking due to changes in new revsions, Exploratorion links libraries that are used to CDN

CDNs used:

* [CDNJS]( https://cdnjs.com/ )
	* <https://cdnjs.com/libraries/three.js>
* [RawGit]( https://rawgit.com/ )
	* Example: <https://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r70/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js>

As in:

```
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r71/build/three.min.js ></script>  
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r71/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js ></script>
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r71/examples/js/libs/stats.min.js ></script>  
```

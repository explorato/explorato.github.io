Welcome to the Exploratoria home page!

Exploratoria is a GitHub Organization. Feel free to request an invitation to join. 


## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To devise [free, open source scripts]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software )
that help visualize and further understanding of scientific, technical, engineering and mathematical 
([STEM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics )) concepts

* To supply simple yet powerful scripts that help engineers and designers to create experiments without having to be dedicated software '[full stack programmers]( https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-term-full-stack-programmer-mean )'

* To help youngsters and oldsters delve into new topics with a hands-on, active, 'I can play with this' approach
<br><!-- link to pedagogy page / code edit view / things to try -->

* To create apps that work not just on computers but also on mobile devices such as phones and tablets  
<!-- Internet of things / hack the hardware / link back to physical exhibits / add AR to physical exhibits -->

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help envision new types of visualizations

* To help people understand, tackle and push the envelope with increasingly complicated tasks based on the [scientific method]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method )


## Exhibits

The intention is to provide scripts dealing with the following categories:

* Aerospace
* [Astronomy & Solar System]( http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/astronomy/index.html )
* Biology
* [Chemistry]( http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/chemistry/index.html )
* Electricity & Magnetism
* Energy
* Engineering & Structure
* Geology
* [Heat & Temperature]( http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/heat/index.html )
* Human Anatomy
* Language & Speech
* [Light & Color]( http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/light/index.html )
* Materials
* [Mathematics & Patterns]( http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/mathematics/index.html )
* [Mechanics, Dynamics & Motion]( http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/mechanics/index.html )
* Navigation & Mapping
* Smell - Taste - Touch
* Sound & Hearing
* Vision & Eye Logic
* [Waves & Resonance]( http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/waves/index.html )
* Weather & Water

Noticeably absent are categories pertaining to computers, the Internet, digital media and the like. 
This website uses technology to explain, show and demonstrate the physical and theoretical aspects of our world. 
It attempts to achieve the best of what technology should do in the real world.

## Cookbook

Short coding samples - also called snippets - solutions to common tasks, 'presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results'.

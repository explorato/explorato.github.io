## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
* To supply free, open source scripts that help visualize scientific and mathematical concepts

* To supply scripts that help engineers and designers to create visualizations without having to be dedicated software programmers
* To help youngsters and oldsters delve into new topics with a hands-on, active, 'I can play with this' approach

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help create new types of visualizations
* To help people understand, tackle and push the envelope with increasingly complicated tasks

## Apps

The intention is to provide scripts dealing with physics, biology, cartography, math and more

## Cookbook

Short coding samples - also called snippets - solutions to common tasks, 'presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results'.

## Coding Style

The coding style of an app should follow the style of the most-used library of the app.

The font used here is the the default 'monospace' font as determined by your browser. This is because it is the most common font used to write scripts.

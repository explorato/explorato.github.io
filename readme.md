Welcome to the Exploratoria home page!

Exploratoria is a GitHub Organization. Feel free to request an invitation to join. 

_See also the [raw source code]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exploratoria/exploratoria.github.io/master/readme.md ) of this file for notes embedded as comments_

## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
* To supply free, open source scripts that help visualize scientific and mathematical concepts

* To supply scripts that help engineers and designers to create visualizations without having to be dedicated software programmers

* To help youngsters and oldsters delve into new topics with a hands-on, active, 'I can play with this' approach

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help create new types of visualizations

* To help people understand, tackle and push the envelope with increasingly complicated tasks

## Exhibits

The intention is to provide scripts dealing with the following categories:

* Astronomy & Solar System
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Color
* Electricity & Magnetism
* Energy
* Engineering & Structure
* Geology & Materials
* Heat & Temperature
* Human Anatomy
* Language & Speech
* Light
* Mathematics & Patterns
* Mechanics, Dynamics & Motion
* Navigation
* Smell - Taste - Touch
* Sound & Hearing
* Vision & Eye Logic
* Water
* Waves & Resonance
* Weather

<!-- this wording needs work -->
Noticeably absent are categories pertaining to computers, the Internet, digital media and the like. 
This is because the purpose of this website is to use technology to explain, show and demonstrate the physical and theoretical aspects of our world.


## Cookbook

Short coding samples - also called snippets - solutions to common tasks, 'presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results'.

## Templates

These are the files we use to build this web site. You can use them too.

## Coding Style & Colophon

The coding style of an app should follow the style of the most-used library of the app.

In the instance of a [Three.js]( http://threejs.org ) script, the style generally follows [Mr.doob Coding Style]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Mr.doob's-Code-Style%E2%84%A2 ).

The font used here is the the default 'monospace' font as determined by your browser. This is because it is the most common font used to write scripts.

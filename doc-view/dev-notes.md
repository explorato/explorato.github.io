## Discussion

Is it OK that Three.js examples display full screen / under the menu or would it be better to separate menu and example?

Should the various Three.js example types (WebGL, Canvas, etc) be open-able/close-able?

Should we use a pretty font such as 'inconsolida' or stick with the default?

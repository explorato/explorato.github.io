Release Management: Suggestion: Anybody can put anything in the sandbox, but only Paul M can approve if content moves from sandbox to main exhibition areas.
Putting it another way: reticent commiters can do as they please, but willy-nilly commiters must be vetted (Theo: we are looking at you).


Talk: every talk item should be preceded by a category and colon

Email broadcasting: should we have a Google Group?

Informing: Should we have a WordPress Blog?

* WordPress.com has good, free, easy ontology tools - something GitHub lacks 
If every exhibit had a WordPress page, can we use these as a way to curate the exhibits by categories and tags?

Ethics: Should we adopt the [Open Code of Conduct]( http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/ )?  
<https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct/blob/gh-pages/index.md>

Favicon: Add favicon

code snippet edit view: add <https://github.com/julianlam/tabIndent.js>? See also behave.js 

Templates: Should we use traditional HTML '<div></div>' or 'document.body.appendChild( document.createElement( 'div' )' style HTML?

Release Management: Note: I will be switching over from my clunky release system over to the GitHub Release/Tag system.
<< Oops! maybe not. The GitHub Release system is per entire repository. My releases have been tied to individual scripts.
